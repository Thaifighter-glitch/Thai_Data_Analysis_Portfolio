# Joshua Tree Bouldering Climbing Grades
**Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, plotly)  
**Summary:** Cleaned and standardized difficulty ratings for better quantification. Created tables and visualizations to analyze trends in climbing grades.  
**Findings:** Higher-rated climbs tend to have better quality scores, but the number of available routes decreases as difficulty increases.
