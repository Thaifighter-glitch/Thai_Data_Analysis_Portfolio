# Colorado Leaf Peeping

This project predicts and visualizes Colorado‚Äôs fall foliage progression (‚Äúleaf peeping‚Äù) in 2025 using aspen distribution and elevation data.  As a first run, it ignores other variables such as latitude or aspect in affecting leaf color 

## Overview
Aspens turn color at different times depending on elevation and location.  
This project explores those patterns with:
- **QGIS maps** ‚Äì static and animated raster layers by week
- **Tableau dashboard** ‚Äì interactive version for exploration

## Data & Methods (brief)
- **Inputs:** Aspen distribution (vector), elevation bands (raster/lookup), week index.
- **Approach:** Map week ‚Üí elevation band; classify with rule-based symbology; export static + animated maps.
- **Assumptions:** 2025 timing driven primarily by elevation; latitude/aspect not modeled in this first pass.

## QGIS Maps
- **Static Map**:

- **Animated Map** (GIF by week):

**Key Skills:** Raster band classification, cross-join lookup tables, rule-based symbology, QGIS animation.
